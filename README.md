## Roadmap
To empower the GNOME project and its browser project, Epiphany, I've decided to start a repository where I'll be creating some extensions as per my needs. I know it may not be the best way, or the best code, but it works and that's what matters now to have a kick-start.



## Known limitations
- The extensions are based on Manifest V3 support which is supported by Firefox and used by the Chromium base. But the support is still very early and that's why some aspects don't work, which required a bit of a "hack".
- The "background" key of the manifest doesn't work for now, so it was necessary to use the "content_scripts" key to simulate the same effect.
- When activating extensions, it is still necessary to restart the browser for it to take effect.

Please use this repository for extension ideas, tips, general support, and kick-starting a new extension. Thanks.
